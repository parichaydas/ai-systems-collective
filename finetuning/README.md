# Finetuning

This folder holds assets and instructions for model finetuning experiments.

## Purpose

- Collect and store datasets, config files, and example training scripts used for finetuning models.

## Quick Start

1. Place training data under `data/` (create if needed).
2. Add hyperparameter/config under `configs/`.
3. Run your preferred training script (e.g., a PyTorch or Hugging Face example).

## Suggested Structure

- `data/` — datasets
- `configs/` — training configs
- `scripts/` — training/evaluation scripts
